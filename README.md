## Description

Selenium is a set of tools that enable the automation of web navigation. In general, it has two main uses:

- Automating web tests.
- Automating highly repetitive web tasks.

There are different ways to use it, some better than others:

- Through Selenium IDE.
- Using the appropriate driver.
- Starting a server and connecting to it.
- In Hub mode.
- It's very easy to start and perform basic tests.
- Everything is done with mouse clicks.
- No prior learning is required.
- Easy to start using the API.
- It allows organizing the code.
- It will open the appropriate browser.
- Offers a common API for all browsers.

### Server

By starting the server and using an API, we can gain more control and perform remote tests. In these tests, we can instruct the server which browser to start to execute the tests.

Later, we will see how to use this API.

#### Advantages:

- It can be used remotely.
- The server can be started and will open the appropriate browser.
- The code can be organized as if it were for production. This also allows it to be stored in a DVCS.

### Hub Mode

In this case, we have servers connecting to a main server, which we will call the Hub. This Hub maintains a pool of tests that it distributes among its "clients."

This allows various machines to run tests simultaneously. Otherwise, it works the same way as the server mode, and any scripts weâ€™ve created before will still work.

#### Advantages:

- All the benefits of server mode.
- It can run as many scripts simultaneously as servers connected to it.

## Who is this course for?

- Students with basic knowledge of web and testing, especially those looking to perform automated testing.
- Testers and QA professionals.
- Test Architects.
- System Administrators.
